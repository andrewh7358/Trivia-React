# Trivia

This is a simple trivia app I made in TypeScript and React.

This trivia app provides multiple choice trivia questions of varying categories.

This project uses [Open Trivia Database](https://opentdb.com/). Open Trivia Database is a user-contributed trivia question database that provides a JSON API to to retrieve trivia questions.
